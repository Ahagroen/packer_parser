Using JSON to encode command strings, rather than XML

Intention is to couple this with a generation tool to automatically generate the schema based on more easy to use systems (web UI)

Need to declare a schema system first, then decode it

First Bit is general, and points to a specific scheme. No effort is made to validate that byte, its assumed the byte correctly describes the right scheme.

Each downlink type is its own scheme, and numbered from 2-255. 0 is reserved for the ping frame and 1 is the commandAck


TODO = Select the right schema object based on flag bits/byte - DONE
TODO = Bit resolution for sub params
TODO = Multiple Schema in one Schema file - DONE

How small can I make it, and how do I make bindings?



For singleton commands -> Commands that take 0 bytes of arguments and are simply sent as is. Define them as you would any other command frame except with an empty required array and empty parameters field. This is decoded as an empty map with 1 keys and 0 values
